            <p>I was seven months old when my mother took me to see a doctor in Suran, my hometown. I had a high fever,
                and she had noticed weakness in both my legs. It was then that I was diagnosed with polio.

                Polio is a highly contagious disease that attacks the nervous system. It can cause paralysis or even
                death among young children. While the disease is not curable, it can easily be prevented by vaccination.
